# About 

You'll replace all of this.

A key strength of Xanthan is its foundation in stable, open-source technologies. Instead of relying on closed commercial services that can change direction, pricing, or availability with little warning, Xanthan is built on tools that are transparent, community maintained, and designed for long-term preservation. Static websites—simple HTML files generated from readable text—have an exceptional track record of durability. They load quickly, require almost no server infrastructure, and can be archived, migrated, or remixed with ease. This makes them an ideal medium for humanities work, where citations, context, and continuity matter as much as visual polish.

Choosing open-source, static tools also encourages technical literacy in a supportive way. Rather than hiding the mechanics of digital publishing, Xanthan exposes just enough to help scholars understand how their work lives on the web. That awareness fosters independence: you can maintain control of your research outputs, experiment with design, and ensure that your projects remain accessible years after grant cycles, institutional platforms, or proprietary services have moved on.

For emerging academics, a stable digital footprint is not just a convenience—it’s an essential part of professional identity. A personal site or project sandbox becomes a space to experiment with ideas, share works-in-progress, document research methods, and demonstrate competencies that don’t always appear on a CV. It offers a home for syllabi, datasets, digital exhibits, StoryMap-like essays, and other forms of public-facing scholarship that increasingly shape how humanities work is evaluated and understood.

A sustainable website also signals to collaborators, hiring committees, and community partners that you take stewardship of your work seriously. Instead of ephemeral links or platform-bound projects, you can point to a consistent, well-curated portfolio that reflects your scholarly voice. In a field where openness, accessibility, and public engagement are central values, owning your own digital space can be a quiet but powerful form of academic agency.

Xanthan is designed to support that agency. It gives you a long-lasting foundation to build on, a flexible workshop for creative experimentation, and a publishing model that aligns with the principles of open scholarship. Whether you’re drafting your first digital exhibit or building a long-term research hub, Xanthan provides a reliable place for your work to grow.
