# Working with Xanthan's Design System

Xanthan uses CSS variables (like `var(--spacing-md)`) for consistent design. When asking for changes, you can:

**Reference existing variables:**
> "Use the accent-primary color for all buttons"

**Ask about the system:**
> "What color variables are available?"
> "What spacing sizes can I use?"

**Request system-aware changes:**
> "Increase spacing but stay consistent with the design system"

The AI understands Xanthan's structure and will suggest changes that fit the existing patterns.

## Common Customizations to Try

Once you're comfortable, try these common requests:

### Typography
- "Make body text use a serif font"
- "Increase line spacing in paragraphs"
- "Make h2 headings bold"

### Colors
- "Create a dark mode theme"
- "Change the accent color to teal"
- "Make links a brighter blue"

### Spacing
- "Add more space around images"
- "Reduce the gap between sections"
- "Increase padding in navigation items"

### Layout
- "Make the content area wider"
- "Center the page content"
- "Add a border around code blocks"
