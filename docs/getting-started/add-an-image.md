# Add an Image

You've edited text. Now let's add an image to your site---the full process from uploading the file to seeing it on a page.

---

## Upload the image

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to the **`assets/images/`** folder
3. Click **"Add file"** then **"Upload files"**
4. Drag and drop an image from your computer (JPG or PNG work well)
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

Your image is now in your repository at `assets/images/your-image.jpg`.

---

## Add it to a page

1. Press **`.`** on your repository page to open the code editor
2. Open the page where you want the image (e.g., `index.md`)
3. Paste this code where you want the image to appear:

```
{%raw%}{% include images/figure.html
  image-path="assets/images/your-image.jpg"
  class="center"
  width="60%"
  caption="A brief description of what's shown."
  alt-text="Describe the image for screen readers"
%}{%endraw%}
```

4. Replace `your-image.jpg` with your actual filename (capitalization matters)
5. Commit and sync your changes

---

## See it live

Wait 1--2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild, then refresh your site. Your image should appear centered at 60% width with a caption below it.

---

## Quick reference

The `figure.html` include has a few options you can adjust:

- **`class`** --- `left`, `right`, or `center` (controls positioning)
- **`width`** --- any percentage like `40%`, `80%`, `100%`
- **`caption`** --- text that appears below the image
- **`alt-text`** --- description for accessibility (always include this)

For the full range of image options---side-by-side layouts, carousels, full-width jumbotrons, and more---see the [Images guide](../editing/images).
