# ScrollStories

ScrollStories transform academic writing into immersive visual narratives. By combining scholarly depth with dynamic scrolling, they invite readers to experience research as a journey—guided by full-screen images, creative typography, and layered design.

Perfect for public humanities projects, digital history, or visual essays, ScrollStories make complex ideas accessible and engaging. Whether showcasing research findings, historical narratives, or cultural analysis, this format offers a powerful way to share scholarly work that feels both elegant and alive.

## What Makes a ScrollStory?

ScrollStories use specialized components that respond to scrolling, creating a cinematic reading experience:

### Background Images with Text Overlays
Full-screen background images that change as you scroll, with text appearing in semi-transparent boxes over the imagery.

- **[Backgrounds with Scrolly Boxes](bg-scrollbox)** - Static background images with text boxes that scroll over them
- **[Background Switching](bg-switch)** - Background images that change as you scroll through different sections

### Side-Scrolling Sections
Horizontal scrolling text panels that move left while images remain fixed, creating a unique reading flow.

- **[Side Scrolling Text](side-scroll)** - Horizontal text panels with fixed background images

### Standard Components
ScrollStories also use all the standard page components—images, pull quotes, footnotes, headers—styled specifically for the scrolling format.
