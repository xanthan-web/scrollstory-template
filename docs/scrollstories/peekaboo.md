# Peekaboo Images

## How it works

A peekaboo image stays fixed in place while the page scrolls down to reveal it—the opposite of a jumbotron, which moves with the page. As the reader scrolls, the content above slides away and the image comes into view; once fully visible, the page continues scrolling normally with content passing over it.

This is a ScrollStory technique at heart. It works in any page layout, but it's most effective in longer narrative pages where you want a cinematic visual pause between sections.

## Basic usage

The simplest peekaboo uses just `height` and `image-path`. The image stays fixed until fully revealed, then the page scrolls over it.

```
{% raw %}{% include scrollybox/bg.html
  height="60vh"
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include scrollybox/bg.html
  height="60vh"
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
%}

## With a text overlay

You can add a text box that scrolls up over the image after it's revealed. Use `above-box-space` to push the box below the initial viewport, and `below-box-space` to add breathing room after it.

```
{% raw %}{% include scrollybox/bg.html
  height="80vh"
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  above-box-space="40vh"
  below-box-space="20vh"
  box-content="
  ### Something Worth Pausing For

  The text box scrolls up over the image, then the page continues normally.

%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include scrollybox/bg.html
  height="80vh"
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  above-box-space="40vh"
  below-box-space="20vh"
  box-content="
