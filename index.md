# ScrollStory Template for Xanthan

A ready-to-use template for creating immersive narrative essays with scrolling backgrounds, overlays, and visual storytelling. This template is part of [Xanthan](xanthan-web-github.io).

This page is the `index.md` file in your repository. You'll evenually replace everything here with your own introduction to your Scrollstory site.

## Quick Start Checklist
You should be viewing this page at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`

If you're not familiar with [editing your site on GitHub](docs/getting-started/editing-in-github.md), read through the directions on how to do that. 

Then, head over to the [instructions page](instructions).

1. **Update the site name** — Edit `_config.yml` and the `title` field with your project title (just replace "Scrollstory Template")
2. **Start editing the sample essay** — Edit `/your-story/index.md` with your own content
3. **Update images** — Add your background images to `/scrollstory/images/`
4. **Customize About/Bibliography** — Edit `about.md` and `bibliography.md` pages in your root folder of your repository.


### Can I rename the `/scrollstory/` folder?
Yes! But update the link in your navigation (`_data/nav.yml`) to match.
