# Your top nav bar
Xanthan makes it easy to edit your nav bar through a simple data file. The words and links on the top nav bar are controlled by a simple text file that's easy to edit.

You can find and edit this file in your `_data` folder. It's called `top-nav.yml`.

Even if the file syntax is unfamiliar, it is straightforward. If you follow the same pattern as existing links, you can easily add, rename, or remove any of the links to match your site structure and page names.
