# Scrollstories

Scroll stories bring scholarship to life through an immersive, visual narrative experience. Combining the depth of digital essays with the fluidity of scrolling storytelling, they invite readers to move through research as a journey—guided by dynamic images, creative typography, and layered design. Perfect for public humanities projects, scroll stories transform complex ideas into engaging, accessible experiences that blend visual creativity with academic rigor. Whether showcasing research findings, historical narratives, or cultural analysis, scroll stories offer a powerful way to share scholarly work with wider audiences in a format that feels both elegant and alive.

## Sample Stories
We've created three versions of stories that you might want to use as templates. There is a "Forest" Essay the demos all the major features. The "Sapling" essay takes out a few of the more complex elements, and the "seeding" essay is really just the most basic elements. They are all the same otherwise; they differ only in the number of included components.
